**Goliat Dashboard** is a product fully developed with [Astro](https://astro.build/) that presents an interactive dashboard, powered by the [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud) API. The main goal is to provide concise metrics and a better distribution of projects and workspaces, offering a clear and detailed view of managed resources in real-time.

## Features

- **Terraform Cloud Integration:** The dashboard displays up-to-date metrics and a clear distribution of projects and workspaces, fed in real-time by the Terraform Cloud API.
- **Additional integrations:** Support for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) API has been added, and future integrations with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) are planned to provide more insights within the dashboard.
- **Real-time updates:** Thanks to these API integrations, the dashboard does not require any additional configuration or project onboarding processes. Dynamic routes are automatically generated and start showing data once the APIs are connected.
- **Future expansions:** Plans include integrating [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to provide users with additional insights and more detailed information about the projects.

## Project Status
